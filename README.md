# Dracula Mou Theme

Drcula is a dark theme for the awesome [Mou](http://25.io/mou/) markdown editor. This theme is inspired by the [Dracula Terminal Theme](https://draculatheme.com/terminal/). In fact, I created the Mou theme because I enjoy using the terminal theme so much and wanted to have the same theme for my markdown editor of choice.

## Installation

Copy the **Dracula.txt** and **Dracula+.txt** file into your Mou Themes directory.

`~/Library/Application Support/Mou/Themes`

Open Mou's Preferences and navigate to the Themes tab. Select Dracula in the Use Theme: dropdown. If Mou was open when you copied the theme files, you may need to hit the Reload button.
